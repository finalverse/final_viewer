# Roadmap and recommended next milestone

## Current plan — 2026-10-08

Phase 2 world creation and Phase 3 persistent Lumi are implemented development slices; Phase 4A has passed packaged macOS engineering acceptance. Its UI is retained. The Phase 0 ordering below is historical, not the current execution plan.

1. **4B — First impression:** repair appearance compatibility/provisioning, then produce inviting Harbor/Lumi content as reusable semantic, provenance-checked Starter Library seeds. Verify in the actual viewer, preserve identity/history and measure performance.
2. **4B.1 — MutSea Starter Library:** versioned World/Avatar/Outfit/Asset/Experience packages, dependency validation and recoverable account/community provisioning; reusable Harbor and Lumi Home.
3. **4B.5 — First-time study:** 3–5 new people, five-minute observation, address major confusion.
4. **4C — Growth loop:** create/invite/share/join/remix/return over reliable starter provisioning.
5. **5A–5H — MutSea Platform:** communities; world/experience templates; WorldSync and Blender Live; creator hub; third-party SDK; spatial commerce; enterprise; creator economy. Gate expansion on observed growth, not architectural diagrams.

See [platform boundaries](mutsea-platform.md), [updated 4B prompt](prompts/phase4b.md) and [deferred 4C prompt](prompts/phase4c.md). MutSea is the spatial platform/runtime; Finalverse is the consumer experience; Studio is authoring. Renderer migration, public deployment and multi-platform work remain separately gated.

## Historical Phase 0 plan

Phase 2 follows the later user-supplied **AI world-creation vertical slice**, superseding the original split below. The implemented candidate combines inspection, trusted actions, WorldLine, local inference, one Create panel, a 17-component Lumi home and restart/undo. See [phase2-ai-world-creation.md](phase2-ai-world-creation.md) for measured results and the completed visual workflow and normal restart/cleanup evidence. All 15 practical gates pass. Next harden recovery and semantic reconciliation before persistent citizen memory/navigation; no Phase 3 implementation was started. The remaining text preserves the Phase 0 roadmap rationale.

The product direction is an AI-native persistent world client using the mature viewer as bootstrap runtime. The audited source supplies streaming, avatars, camera, chat/voice, editing, inventory, materials and networking; it does not supply a Finalverse brain, policy kernel, semantic sidecar or action journal.

## Critical path

1. Close the verified baseline build/test/run gate described in `upstream-baseline.md`.
2. Phase 1: controlled product identity, artwork, packaging, attribution and separate settings/cache identity; preserve world compatibility. See [the implemented branding milestone](rebranding.md).
3. Phase 2: C++ value/action contracts, permission and capability policy, immutable snapshot adapter; keep all renderer/UI pointers out.
4. Phase 3: one LLUI AI floater and neutral server/local provider bridge, read-only nearby objects first.
5. Phase 4: one bounded owned-object move with observed result, readable operation record and conflict-aware undo.

The recommended first implementation milestone is **baseline repair followed by controlled identity plus a read-only WorldSnapshot adapter**. The measured repair backlog is the Python packaging-test import failure, local avatar cloud appearance and later viewer unresponsiveness/failed SIGTERM shutdown. Reproduce the runtime issue with evidence gathered before termination; its original cause is not established. Do not implement mutations until world-entry behavior and query freshness/coverage are verified. The first mutation then proves the full model-proposal/policy/executor/WorldLine path.

The subsequent Phase 1 work repairs the eight-case packaging suite and implements product identity. The next architectural milestone remains a read-only snapshot adapter and neutral AI shell after the runtime reliability/appearance gaps are addressed. Branding does not satisfy the AI-native MVP.

## Work to defer

Renderer replacement, general world scripting, multi-object atomic claims, destructive deletion, NPC autonomy, Blender runtime embedding and desktop UI compilation for phones. Studio and native mobile UI remain separate surfaces connected by contracts.

## Evidence for choosing this path

`LLAgentListener::getNearbyObjectsList` already supplies structured UUID/region/position data; `LLSelectMgr::sendMultipleUpdate` supplies existing persistent object transform messaging. Wrapping those paths avoids duplicating the world runtime. They need scope/freshness/permission/result handling, not a new renderer. Mobile extraction begins with these new values/policies, since existing llmath, primitive, appearance and window dependencies are not already a mobile shared core.

No calendar estimates are assigned until dependency availability and runtime baseline are verified. [migration-plan.md](migration-plan.md) contains the phase gates; [test-matrix.md](test-matrix.md) defines evidence required for product claims.
